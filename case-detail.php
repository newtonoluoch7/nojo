		<h5>CASE REVIEW</h5>
			<p>The client was seeking a fresh and innovative approach to their branding. With their new product clearly desiring 
				to stand out in a competitive market, they needed a design solution that would capture attention, evoke emotion, 
				and resonate with their target audience. This challenge ignited our creative spirits, and we eagerly dove into the project.
				We chose to showcase usability of the wine in all environments. The main challenge was dealing with the products image quality where we did a clean retouch and provide elite compositions. The client was wowed!</p>

		<h5>RAW MATERIALS</h5>
			<p>We had primary materials with different lighting from the products photography and our stock proposed background, this was a challenge, but that`s what we do, and we loved it. 
				We balanced the lighting and harmonized the product to archieve the desired results.</p>
